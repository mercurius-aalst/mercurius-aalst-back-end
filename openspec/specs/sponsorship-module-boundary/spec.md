## Purpose

Define Sponsorship module ownership, boundaries, persistence, HTTP composition, and lifecycle facts.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Sponsorship owns sponsor and placement implementation
The Sponsorship module SHALL own the Sponsor and TournamentSponsorPlacement implementation types,
application services, validation, endpoint mapping, and persistence configuration. Its public
surface MUST be limited to intentional contracts and composition extensions.

#### Scenario: API composes Sponsorship
- **WHEN** the API application starts
- **THEN** it MUST register Sponsorship through `AddSponsorshipModule`
- **AND** map the existing sponsor routes through `MapSponsorshipModule`

#### Scenario: Sponsorship implementation remains internal
- **WHEN** another module references Sponsorship
- **THEN** Sponsor entities, EF adapters, CRUD services, and endpoint implementation types MUST
  NOT be available through the Sponsorship contracts project

### Requirement: Sponsorship uses explicit module dependencies
Sponsorship SHALL consume Tournament facts only through external tournament identifiers and SHALL
consume image storage only through `Media.Contracts`. It MUST NOT reference Tournament or Media
implementation projects, their EF entities, DbContexts, repositories, or internal services.

#### Scenario: Sponsor placement is changed for a tournament
- **WHEN** Tournament calls `ISponsorshipModule` to replace a tournament's sponsor placement
- **THEN** Sponsorship MUST store the supplied tournament identifier as an external reference
- **AND** it MUST NOT load or navigate to a Tournament entity

#### Scenario: Sponsor logo is stored
- **WHEN** a sponsor is created or its logo is replaced
- **THEN** Sponsorship MUST store the media URL returned through `IMediaModule`
- **AND** it MUST NOT invoke a Media implementation service directly

### Requirement: Sponsorship owns tournament sponsor placement behavior
Sponsorship SHALL own the one-to-one placement for each tournament, including sponsor identity, context,
headline, support line, and display order. A placement change MUST validate a non-null sponsor
before persisting it and MUST preserve the existing not-found validation outcome.

#### Scenario: Placement is created or replaced
- **WHEN** a valid `SponsorPlacementInput` is supplied for a tournament identifier
- **THEN** Sponsorship MUST create or update that tournament's single placement with the supplied values
- **AND** the corresponding Tournament read model MUST receive the placement through
  `ISponsorshipModule`

#### Scenario: Placement is removed
- **WHEN** `null` is supplied as the placement for a tournament identifier
- **THEN** Sponsorship MUST remove that tournament's existing placement
- **AND** subsequent Sponsorship and Tournament reads MUST report no placement

### Requirement: Sponsorship read models are bounded and persistence-compatible
Sponsorship read operations SHALL use no-tracking projections and SHALL provide a bounded batched
placement lookup for a supplied set of tournament identifiers. It MUST retain the existing `Sponsors` and
`TournamentSponsorPlacements` tables, scalar mapping, unique tournament placement constraint, and cascade
relationships; the Phase 20 rename migration MUST preserve those relationships while moving the
placement table and foreign key to the canonical tournament identifiers.

#### Scenario: Tournament enriches multiple tournaments
- **WHEN** Tournament requests placements for multiple tournament identifiers
- **THEN** Sponsorship MUST return the matching placement summaries from a bounded query
- **AND** it MUST NOT issue one placement query per tournament identifier

#### Scenario: Existing database is composed
- **WHEN** the shared EF model is built after the extraction
- **THEN** Sponsorship MUST map the existing Sponsor and TournamentSponsorPlacement schema and preserve
  the tournament-to-placement and sponsor-to-placement cascade behavior

### Requirement: Existing Sponsorship HTTP contracts remain stable
The extraction MUST preserve sponsor route templates, route names and tags, API version metadata,
authorization metadata, antiforgery metadata, form request binding, validation outcomes, response
JSON shapes, and anonymous read access.

#### Scenario: Existing client uses a sponsor endpoint
- **WHEN** a client calls an existing sponsor list, detail, create, update, or delete endpoint
- **THEN** the same route, authorization requirement, request shape, and response JSON contract
  MUST apply

#### Scenario: Existing client uses the tournament sponsor placement endpoint
- **WHEN** a client replaces a tournament's sponsor placement through the existing Tournament endpoint
- **THEN** the existing route, authorization, validation, and tournament response JSON MUST remain
  unchanged

### Requirement: Sponsorship publishes lifecycle facts
Sponsorship mutations SHALL publish typed integration-event contracts in the `Contracts.V1`
namespace without exposing EF entities. Events MUST describe sponsor creation, update, deletion,
and tournament sponsor placement changes, including the relevant SponsorId and TournamentId or PlacementId
facts needed by later consumers.

#### Scenario: Sponsor metadata changes
- **WHEN** a sponsor is created, updated, or deleted
- **THEN** Sponsorship MUST publish the matching `Contracts.V1.SponsorCreated`,
  `Contracts.V1.SponsorUpdated`, or `Contracts.V1.SponsorDeleted` event through the durable module
  eventing boundary

#### Scenario: Tournament placement changes
- **WHEN** a tournament's sponsor placement is created, replaced, or removed
- **THEN** Sponsorship MUST publish a `Contracts.V1.TournamentSponsorPlacementChanged` event that
  identifies the tournament
- **AND** the event MUST represent either the current placement facts or the removal state
